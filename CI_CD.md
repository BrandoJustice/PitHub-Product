# Implement CI/CD for product team:
Our team's CI/CD development, test, and production architecture is within our GitHub repository and synced to our azure hosting account. We have updated our repository to push the edits to the free web posting with Azure weekly. We have determined that the free hosting service on Azure will not have enough space to host videos on it, so we decided to implement YouTube embed to save space on our server. But for future versions, we will need to purchase a much larger server to provide the MP4 video hosting. In addition, we will be working on command-line utility, which is an essential part of development. We will be providing more details on this in future sprints. 

# Implement CI/CD for customers (users):
From the end-user perspective, we need to ensure that the end user's ability to upload, store, and delete videos is a simple process. To help us be successful at this, we can use the CI/CD pipeline for a continuous process in our development and testing phases. 

We will configure the end-user environment for testing and development by keeping to the best practices. We will develop and test continuously thinking always from the user perspective. We will include documentation of the coding environment, bugs, and solutions. We will also make sure that we learn from each testing and test early throughout production and development. 

# Sustainably document CI/CD team philosophy and detailed implementation:
To implement our CI/CD pipeline, we will create a server list architecture using containers that will help us package and ship applications in a portable way and make our scale up or tear down the environment easily. The CI/CD development environment will be hosted live through Azure or AWS. Our development environment will help us keep to the CI/CD Pipeline and have many opportunities for testing and learning to develop the most successful user-friendly video management system.  

We will each develop sections of the video management system and continuously collaborate through the development process, including testing earlier and testing often. Each team member from the development team will document each step of the process, including failures, bugs, and solutions in our team discord.  

We will create a google doc that the users can access quickly and report their interactions or experiences with the PitHub video management system. We will also have live testing sessions on zoom to understand the user's experiences with Pithub.
